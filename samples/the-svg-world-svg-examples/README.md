## Features

This application gives you a general idea how SVGs can be used in Power Apps and provides the source code for some advanced techniques:
1. Display maps through SVG path elements, with the use of the CONCAT() function
2. Create different kind of charts
3. basic and complex concepts of animating SVGs to highlight/move/zoom

## Prerequisites

You and everyone viewing the app needs to use the `.` as decimal separator (`1.0` not `1,0`) otherwise some SVGs won't work, because SVG-code requires this format!
Just change your language to English in your browser settings!

## Data Sources

The excel file is included in the msapp-file as a static datasource, but is also included her for [Download](./assets/TheSvgWorldDataset.xlsx)

## Minimal Path to Awesome

* [Download](./solution/TheSvgWorld.msapp) the `.msapp` from the `solution` folder
* Within **Power Apps Studio**, use the `.msapp` file using **File** > **Open** > **Browse** and select the `.msapp` file you just downloaded.
* Select the **Data** tab

## Using the Source Code

You can also use the [Power Apps CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/data-platform/powerapps-cli) to pack the source code by following these steps::

* Clone the repository to a local drive
* Pack the source files back into `.msapp` file:
  ```bash
  pac canvas pack --sources pathtosourcefolder --msapp pathtomsapp
  ```
  Making sure to replace `pathtosourcefolder` to point to the path to this sample's `sourcecode` folder, and `pathtomsapp` to point to the path of this solution's `.msapp` file (located under the `solution` folder)
* Within **Power Apps Studio**, use the `.msapp` file using **File** > **Open** > **Browse** and select the `.msapp` file you just packed.
