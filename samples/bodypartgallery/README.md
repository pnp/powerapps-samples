# Gallery Component

## Summary

Happy to share some of my PowerApps projects that I think might be interesting with the community. I tend to spend too much time on UI/UX and I hope someone else finds them useful for their project . . . Just load the .msapp file and customise it to your heart's content.

## Features

This sample illustrates the following concepts:

* Manipulating UI


## Prerequisites

### Using the component

Selecting each of the dots insert the name of the corresponding body part into a collection. The color of the selected dot also changes, with a correspodning title. Selecting the dot again deselects it and remove the body part form the collection.

If you have a form with a datacard driven by multichoice field, you can just copy the container into the datacard. A collection named `col_BodyPart` captures all the selection. 

You can also use `TextInput_ManualInput` to capture free text, in case users need the option to enter such.

Update for the datacard can look like this

```If(
    !(IsBlank(TextInput_ManualInput)),
    TextInput_ManualInput.Text,
    Concat(
        col_BodyPart,
        Value & ", "
    )
)
```

To change the colours of any of the controls, Navigate to the Screen_Style.
