## Features

This sample illustrates the following concepts:

* Creating a Power Apps component
* Using a Power Apps component

## Prerequisites

### Using the component

To use the component in this sample, you'll need to pass events to display in the calendar.

You can do this by connecting to a data source which provides a `Date`, a `Title` and a `Time` field, or you can manually create entries and pass them as a `Table`, as follows:

```excel
Table(
    {
        Date: "5/3/2021",
        Title: "Meeting",
        Time: "2:30pm"
    },
     {
        Date: "5/4/2021",
        Title: "MBAS PVA",
        Time: "1:00pm"
    },
    {
        Date: "5/5/2021",
        Title: "PnP AMA Power Platform",
        Time: "3:00pm"
    }
)
```

## Data Sources
 
None

## Minimal Path to Awesome

* [Download](./solution/calendar-component.msapp) the `.msapp` from the `solution` folder
